    <h1>Pelmeni</h1>
    <img src="pelmeni.jpg" width="700" height="500">
    <p>Pelmeni are Russian meat-filled dumplings. Making them is a favorite family pastime during the long winter months.</p>
    <p>These dumplings are a common convenience food.Large batches can be frozen and quickly</p>
    <p>boiled or fried on demand. We usually double this recipe in our house and fold about 200 pieces. </p> 
    <p>Pelmeni are usually served with sour cream or vinegar.</p>

        <li>
            <p>Make dough: Combine egg, oil, and salt in a liquid measuring cup; add enough warm water to fill to 1 cup.</p>

            <p>let dough rest for 30 minutes.</p> 
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Meanwhile, make filling: Combine ground beef, onion, water, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl;</p>
